// This file contains basic forms of the classes that will exist in the
// application.

// You can use them to build your views.

// Your widget for displaying all of the entries will be passed a list of
// categories, [categories], which it will use to generate the tabs (i.e. if
// there are only two categories, only two tabs will be built). If there are
// too many tabs to display on the tab bar, the user should be able to slide the
// tab bar horizontally to reveal the extra tabs.

// Number of categories => `categories.length`

// Each tab view will be passed the list of entries belonging to the category,
// accessed with `categories[i].entries`, where `i` is the index of the tab that
// you are on.

// Your tile widget will be passed a single entry object so that it can display
// the image and the name. Make sure the name/title is coming from the entry object,
// and not the images file name.

// Your widget for displaying the details for an entry will be passed a single
// entry object, from which you will be able to determine the title, content
// text, path to image, path to pronunciation file (if any), and path to bird
// call file (if any).
